ESP32 Firmware for Frequency-hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC Key System using Arduino (328p, SAMD51)

Title: ESP32 Firmware Development Proposal for Frequency-hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC Key System

1. Introduction

This proposal aims to outline the development of custom firmware for the ESP32, which will enable it to interface with a SAMD51 chipset-based board and serve as the RF module in a Frequency-hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC key system. This system will be responsible for generating and maintaining frequency hopping patterns and ensuring secure and reliable communication over the wireless network.

2. Background

Frequency-hopping Spread Spectrum is a method where the communication signal is spread over rapidly changing frequencies. Each available frequency band is divided into sub-frequencies. Signals rapidly change ("hop") among these in a pre-determined order. It can be used to avoid interference, preventing interception, and stopping unauthorized access to wireless networks.

3. Objective

The primary objective is to develop custom firmware for the ESP32 to ensure it can:

- Generate and maintain frequency hopping patterns.
- Interface with SAMD51 chipset-based boards using SPI.
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using TRANSEC keys.
- Ensure robust and reliable communication by incorporating synchronization, error correction, and auto-repeat request (ARQ) mechanisms.

4. Key Features

4.1 Frequency Hopping

- The ESP32 will use its internal clock to maintain synchronization.
- The hopping pattern will be generated using True Random Number Generators.
- The ESP32 shall be able to communicate over a range of frequency channels and switch between these channels in a pseudo-random fashion.

4.2 TRANSEC Key Management

- Generate TRANSEC keys using the hardware TRNG of SAMD51.
- Receive, store, and manage TRANSEC keys for encryption/decryption.
- Utilize the TRANSEC keys in encrypting/decrypting payloads.

4.3 Interface with SAMD51

- Communication with the SAMD51 microcontroller through SPI.
- Receive frequency-hopping patterns and TRANSEC keys from SAMD51.
- Send and receive data packets to and from SAMD51.

4.4 Synchronization

- Implement time synchronization with the SAMD51 board.
- Handle synchronization of hopping patterns between multiple ESP32 modules.

4.5 Error Correction and ARQ

- Implement error correction coding (ECC) to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data.
- Implement ARQ for automatic re-transmission in case of failed communication.

4.6 Security

- Implement secure communication channels.
- Utilize encryption for TRANSEC key exchanges.

5. Tools and Technologies

- ESP-IDF: Espressif IoT Development Framework for programming the ESP32.
- SPI communication protocol.
- SAMD51 development environment.
